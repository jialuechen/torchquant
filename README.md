S0 = 100.0
T = 1.0
true_params = {
    'kappa': 2.0,
    'theta': 0.04,
    'sigma_v': 0.3,
    'rho': -0.7,
    'v0': 0.04,
    'mu': 0.05
}

np.random.seed(42)
torch.manual_seed(42)
heston_true = Heston(**true_params)
S_observed = heston_true.simulate(S0=S0, T=T, N=N_observed)

# Initialize the Heston model with initial guesses
heston_model = Heston(
    kappa_init=1.0,
    theta_init=0.02,
    sigma_v_init=0.2,
    rho_init=-0.5,
    v0_init=0.02,
    mu_init=0.0
)

# Set up the calibrator
calibrator = model_calibrator(
    model=heston_model,
    observed_data=S_observed.detach().cpu().numpy(),  # Convert tensor to numpy array
    S0=S0,
    T=T,
    lr=0.01
)

# Calibrate the model
calibrator.calibrate(num_epochs=1000, steps=100, verbose=True)

# Get the calibrated parameters
calibrated_params = calibrator.get_calibrated_params()
print("Calibrated Parameters:")
for name, value in calibrated_params.items():
    print(f"{name}: {value:.6f}")
```

## Seq2Seq PDE Solver
```python
from torchquantlib.utils import Seq2SeqPDESolver
# Define model parameters
input_dim = 1      # Adjust based on your input features
hidden_dim = 64    # Number of features in the hidden state
output_dim = 1     # Adjust based on your output features
num_layers = 2     # Number of stacked LSTM layers

# Initialize the model, loss function, and optimizer
model = Seq2SeqPDESolver(input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim, num_layers)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop (simplified)
num_epochs = 100
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(src, trg)
    loss = criterion(output, trg)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

from torchquantlib.core.risk.credit_risk.reduced_form_model import reduced_form_model

asset_value = torch.tensor(100.0)
debt = torch.tensor(80.0)
volatility = torch.tensor(0.2)
rate = torch.tensor(0.05)
expiry = torch.tensor(1.0)

# Merton Model
equity_value = merton_model(asset_value, debt, volatility, rate, expiry)
print(f'Equity Value (Merton Model): {equity_value.item()}')

lambda_0 = torch.tensor(0.02)
default_intensity = torch.tensor(0.05)
recovery_rate = torch.tensor(0.4)
